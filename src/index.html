<p>JESUS that sprang of Jesse’s root, <br>	
As us hath preached the prophete, <br>	
Flower and fruit both soft and soot <br>
To mannis soul of savour sweet;	<br>
Jesu, Thou broughtest man to boot <br>	    
When Gabriel gan Mary greet,<br>	
To fell our foemen under foot,	<br>
In her Thou sit’st a seemly seat;	<br>
A maiden was Thy mother meet,	<br>
Of whom Thou tookest flesh for us;	 <br>    
As ye may both my balës beet, <br>
So be my comfort, Christ Jesus.	</p>
 
<p>Jesu, Thou art wisdom of wit, <br>	
Of Thy Father full of might!<br>	
Mannis soul to saven it,<br>	     
In poor apparel Thou wert dight.<br>	
Jesu, Thou were in cradle knit	<br>
In weedë wrapped both day and night,<br>	
In Bethlehem born, as the gospel writ,<br>	
With angels’ song and heaven light.	<br>      
Bairn y-born of a birdë bright,	<br>
Full courteous was Thy comely cus;	<br>
Through virtue of that sweetë light, <br>	
So be my comfort, Christ Jesus.	</p>
 
<p>Jesu, that were of yearës young,	 <br>      
Fair and fresh of hide and hue,	<br>
When Thou were in thraldom throng <br>
And tormented with many a Jew;	<br>
When blood and water were out-wrong,<br>	
For beating was Thy body blue;<br>	       
As a clod of clay Thou were for-clong, <br>	
So dead in trough then men Thee threw.	<br>
But grace out of Thy gravë grew;<br>	
Thou rose up quick, comfort to us.	<br>
For her love that this counsel knew,<br>	    
So be my comfort, Christ Jesus.	</p>
 
<p>Jesu, soothfast God and Man,	<br>
Two kindis knit in one persone,	<br>
The wonder work that Thou began,<br>	
Thou hast fulfilled in flesh and bone.<br>	     
Out of this world wytely Thou wan,	<br>
Lifting up Thyself alone;<br>	
For mightily Thou rose, and ran	<br>
Straight unto Thy Father in throne.	<br>
Now dare man make no morë moan;	 <br>      
For man it is Thou wroughtë thus,<br>	
And God with man is made at one,<br>	
So be my comfort, Christ Jesus.	</p>
 
<p>Jesu, my sovereign Saviour,<br>	
Almighty God, there be no mo;	<br>   
Christ, be Thou my Governour,	<br>
Thy faith let me not fallen fro. <br>
Jesu, my joy and my succour,	<br>
In my body and soul also,	<br>
God, be Thou my strongest food,<br>
And wis Thou me when me is woe.	<br>
Lord, Thou makest friend of foe,<br>	
Let me not live in languor thus,	<br>
But see my sorrow, and say now “ho!”	<br>
And be my comfort, Christ Jesus.</p>
 
<p>Jesu, to Thee I cry and greed,	<br>
Prince of Peace, to Thee I pray;	<br>
Thou wouldest bleed for mannis need, <br>	
And suffer many a fearful fray.	<br>
Thou me feed in all my dread	<br>   
With patïencë now and ay	<br>
My life to lead in word and deed,	<br>
As is most pleasant to Thy pay, <br>
And to die well when it is my day.	<br>
Jesu, that died on tree for us,	<br>    
Let me not be the fiendis prey, <br>	
But be my comfort, Christ Jesus.    Amen.</p>
